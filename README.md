# TShirtFoldingBot
Code to the t-shirt folding robot I built during my time at UC Davis COSMOS Cluster 5: Computers in Biophysics and Robotics. 

In the summer of 2022, I participated in the COSMOS program at UC Davis, where I expanded my knowledge in robotics and STEM through attending lectures, being taught my professors, and creating my own projects in class. This was my final project, where I constructed a t-shirt folding robot that was initially intended to only fold t-shirts, but was eventually upgraded to fold long sleeve shirts, formal shirts, and almost any other top. 

This code was coded in RobotC, the language that the LEGO EV3 brains use to interpret what to do. 

_TShirtFolderBrain1.c_ contains the code for the first (main) brain. This brain has the 2 arm motor and 2 base motors connected to it.
_TShirtFolderBrain2.c_ contains the code for the second brain. This brain has only the button attached to it that, when pushed, would complete the final flip. 

[Here is the link](https://sites.google.com/view/akshatc5portfolio/robotics) to the entire process of creating the robot. Please look through this to understand my process as well as see the final demonstration and poster board.

This project was presented at a symposium with 200+ parents, professors, and students in attendance.
